# Object Oriented Design Pattern in JAVA

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the implementation of various design patterns in Java! 
This repository is a comprehensive collection of popular design patterns, such as `Singleton, Factory, Builder, Observer,` and many others.

The implementations are inspired by the classic book `Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software` by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, 
often referred to as the Gang of Four (GoF) book. 

Additionally, insights and practical examples from `Head First Design Patterns` by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson have been used to enrich the implementations. 

Each design pattern is presented with detailed explanations and examples to demonstrate their practical use cases. Whether you're a Java developer looking to improve your understanding of design patterns or a software engineer exploring best practices for building scalable and maintainable applications, this repository has something for everyone. 

In this repository, you will learn the following design patterns with different examples and implementations.


* Behavioral
* Creational
* Structural  


Let's have a very quick look at what these patterns are:

### Behavioral design patterns

> Behavioral design patterns focus on the interaction between objects and how they communicate and collaborate with each other.
> They help to improve the flexibility and extensibility of the system by decoupling its components.

### Creational design patterns

> Creational design patterns are concerned with object creation mechanisms, providing a way to create objects in a manner that 
> is flexible, efficient, and adheres to good object-oriented design principles.

### Structural design pattern

> Structural design patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures and relationships. These patterns help 
> developers design and manage the relationships between different parts of a software system, enabling them to create flexible, efficient, and maintainable code.

and these 3 design patterns are subdivided in following categories

* Behavioral
    - Chain of Responsibility 
    - Command
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Observer
    - Strategy
    - Memento
    - State  
    - Template
    - Visitor
    

* Creational
  * Builder
  * Factory
  * Prototype
  * Singleton
  
    
* Structural
  * Adapter
  * Bridge

Feel free to explore the code, learn from the examples, and contribute to this ever-growing resource of design pattern knowledge. Happy coding!
